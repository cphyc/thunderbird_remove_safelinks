# Thunderbird remove safelinks

When using Outlook as your mail provider, it mingles the links found in the email with a feature named "safelinks".
I personally don't like it at all, because it prevents you from assessing whether the email points to a safe destination or not.

It is unfortunately impossible to deactive the safelink feature (except for personal account I guess?), and this is where this extension comes in play.
It replaces all occurrences of safelinks from thunderbirds emails, and replaces them by their original value.
